## Day 1: Building a Weather Data Collection System Using AWS S3 and OpenWeather API

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates core DevOps principles by building a Weather Data Collection System that integrates:

- **External API Integration**: OpenWeather API
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Programming**: Python
- **Error Handling**
- **Environment Management**

### Features
- Fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities.
- Displays temperature (°F), humidity, and weather conditions.
- Automatically stores weather data in an AWS S3 bucket.
- Supports multiple cities tracking.
- Timestamps all data for historical tracking.

### Setup and Installation

#### Prerequisites
1. **AWS Account**: Create an AWS account if you don’t already have one.
2. **AWS CLI**: Install the AWS Command Line Interface ([AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)).
3. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.7 or later is installed on your system.
4. **OpenWeather API Key**: Sign up at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) and obtain an API key.
